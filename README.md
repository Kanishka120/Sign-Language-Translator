# ISL to BSL Translator

## Overview
The ISL to BSL Gesture Translator is a real-time system designed to interpret gestures in Indian Sign Language (ISL) and translate them into their corresponding British Sign Language (BSL) gestures. Using machine learning and computer vision, this project promotes inclusivity and enhances communication for sign language users across different linguistic regions.

## Features
- **Real Time Gesture Recognition :** Detects ISL gestures in real time using webcam.
- **ISL to BSL mapping :** Each ISL gesture is translated to its equivalent gesture in BSL.
- **On-screen Result :** The translation is shown as text on the video feed.
- **Pre Trained Model :** Uses a neural network trained on specific datasets for recognition.
- **Extenibility :** Extendable to include more gestures and other sign languages.
